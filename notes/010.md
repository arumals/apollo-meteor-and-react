# Auto Refetching and Query Prop Assignment.

It is possible to perform a refetch after one mutation.

1. Open the `App.js` component and give the query a name.

  ```js
  const resolutionsQuery = gql`
    query Resolutions {
        resolutions {
            _id
            name
        }
    }
  `;
  ```

2. Then open the `ResolutionsForm.js` and invoque this query as part of the mutation options.

  ```js
  export default graphql(createResolution, { 
    name: 'createResolution',
    options: {
      refetchQueries: [
        'Resolutions'
      ]
    }
  })(Resolution);
  ```

It's also possible to give a better processing for the props in the query, inside the `App.js` we can define this as an arrow function.

  ```js
  export default graphql(resolutionsQuery, {
      props: ({ data }) => ({ ...data })
  })(App);
  ```
