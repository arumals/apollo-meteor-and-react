# Custom resolvers for useful data.

Now we need mark all the resolutions which have all their goals completed.

1. Add the completed property over the resolution type `imports/api/resolutions/schema.js`.

  ```js
  import gql from 'graphql-tag';

  export default gql`
    type Resolution {
      ...
      completed: Boolean
    }
    ...
  `;
  ```

2. Add the resolver for the resolution completed property `imports/api/resolutions/resolvers.js`.

  ```js
  // ...

  export default {
    // ...
    Resolution: {
      // ...
      completed: resolution => Goals.find({ resolutionId: resolution._id, completed: false }).count() == 0,
    },
    // ...
  }
  ```

3. Update the resolution query, to provide the completed value over the resolution type `imports/ui/App.js`.

  ```js
  const resolutionsQuery = gql`
    query Resolutions {
        resolutions {
            _id
            name
            completed
            ...
        }
        ...
    }
  `;
  ```
