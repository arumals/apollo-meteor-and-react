# Custom Resolvers.

As well as the Query we can resolve other types, for example in the User schema we can also resolve the User type.

1. Open the `users/resolvers.js` and add the `user` resolver.

  ```js
  import get from 'lodash/get';

  // export the resolver
  export default {
    Query: {
      user(obj, args, context){
        return context.user || {};
      }
    },
    User: {
      email: (user) => get(user,'emails[0].address',''),
    }
  }
  ```

2. Now update the query en graphiql and you'll see that the email is being resolved.

  ```graphql
  {
    resolutions {
      _id
      name
    }
    user {
      _id
      email
    }
  }
  ```
